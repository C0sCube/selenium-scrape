Treatment of Transactions received with invalid ARNs in view of AMFI Best Practices Guidelines
Circular No.111 /2023-24 dated Feb 02, 2024:
Guidelines for Processing of transactions received under Regular Plan with invalid ARN
Transactions received in Regular Plan with Invalid ARN to be processed in Direct Plan of the
same Scheme (even if reported in Regular Plan), applying the below logic:

Transaction Primary ARN Sub EUIN* Execution Regular
Type Distributor only Plan/
ARN mentioned Direct

Note:
1) *If the EUIN is invalid/missing, the transactions shall be processed in Regular plan, and the
distributor/investor shall be given 30 day period from the date of the transaction for
remediation of the EUIN. In such cases, the investor to be advised to either provide a different
EUIN linked to the ARN who would be engaged in servicing the investor OR switch to Direct
Plan. The commission shall not be paid to the ARN holder if the Switch transaction does not
happen, or fresh EUIN is not provided within 30 days. The commission may be paid if the fresh
EUIN is provided by client within 30 days.
2) For SIP & STP facilities, the ARN validity shall be verified / validated at the time of registration.
For instances where the registration details not available in RTA records the transaction shall
be treated as lumpsum purchase for validations. Distributors must reconcile the active /
inactive SIPs with RTA’s at regular intervals.
3) SIPs registered under ARN of deceased to continue till end of SIP registration period or
investor’s request as per AMFI guidelines; No fresh transactions or SIPs to be booked under the
ARN of deceased MFD post cancellation of ARN at AMFI.
4) Only Sub-distributor’s ARN with valid “ARN-“ values in the transaction will be considered for
validation of Sub- distributor ARN for all types of transactions (lumpsum/SIP/STP).
5) If the ARN is invalid as on date of SIP / STP registration, such registration and future
transactions thereunder will be processed under DIRECT plan.
6) Transactions other than the physical mode which are found to be not in order basis above
matrix, will be rejected at the time of upload / submission for following reasons: To give
opportunity for the intermediary / platform to rectify details before submitting transactions or
to report transactions as DIRECT.
If these transactions are accepted and processed as DIRECT, the intermediary placing the
transaction will not be receiving reverse feeds and hence will not be able to reconcile.
Since the validation cannot be carried out at the time of acceptance or transactions received
in physical form, , the same will be done at the time of processing the transaction, and if found
to be invalid, the transaction will be processed under DIRECT.
7) Transactions received from the stock exchange platforms in Demat mode with invalid ARN
shall be rejected instead of processing in Direct Plan for following reasons –
a) Settlement of units will fail at clearing corporation due to mismatch of ISIN.
6
b) If the RTA processes the transaction in DIRECT Plan, the AMC will face issues with corporate
action wherein the clearing corporation will not be able to reconcile and credit the units.
c) The distributor/broker will not be able to download the reverse feed/mail back report for the
transactions reported by the respective distributor in case if we process under Direct Plan.
The Scheme will have a common portfolio across various Plans/Options. The NAVs of the
Growth Option under both plans will be different and will be declared separately.

the investment profile of the scheme shall be implemented only in accordance with the provisions of sub regulation (15A)
of Regulation 18 & Regulation 25(26) of the SEBI Regulations 1996, as detailed later in this document.
WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?
The strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio of debt, equity and arbitrage instruments with an endeavour to generate
consistent returns with minimal volatility and downside risks. The investment strategy will be active in nature. The allocation
between debt and equity will be managed dynamically with an intent to generate income and capital appreciation
opportunities.
• The scheme shall invest in debt Investments ranging from government securities, AAA bonds to permissible
investment grade papers with an intent to benefit from periodical accrual. Allocation across the rating and duration
spectrum shall be typically based on the macro interest rate outlook and credit worthiness of the underlying
issuers. Such investments may be held till maturity or tactical call to churn / book capital gains may be pursued
based on rating upgrades, fundamental events, short-term interest rate movements etc. The debt investments will
typically be subject to a detailed credit evaluation and liquidity assessment. The debt instruments would primarily
be a capital amortising structure to provide periodical liquidity. The scheme shall also have a reasonable allocation
to highly marketable instruments to enable liquidity buffer.
• The scheme may invest in equity and equity related instruments across sectors and market caps with an intent to
generate capital appreciation. Stock evaluation and decision to invest would typically be based on a detailed
review of company fundamentals and underlying valuations in relation to growth prospects. Tactical allocation
would be made in companies with strong cash flows and high dividend yields / periodical buy-back track record.
Fund Manager will retain the flexibility to hedge majority of the equity portfolio to minimize volatility. Opportunistic
investments in equity special situations (corporate actions linked event arbitrage) like open offers, buy-backs,
mergers, de-mergers, delisting, IPOs, etc, shall be made from time to time post detailed evaluation.
17
• The Scheme may invest in various derivative instruments which are permissible under the applicable regulations.
Such investments shall be subject to the investment objective and strategy of the scheme and the internal limits
if any, as laid down from time to time. These include but are not limited to futures (both stock and index) and
options (stock and index).
Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses
to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities.
Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund
manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or excuse
such strategies.
The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with
investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
Portfolio Turnover: The scheme being an open-ended scheme, it is expected that there would be frequent subscriptions
and redemptions. Hence, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the
portfolio. If trading is done frequently there may be an increase in transaction cost such as brokerage paid etc. The fund
manager shall endeavour to optimize portfolio turnover to maximize gains and minimize risks keeping in mind the cost
associated with it. The Scheme has no specific target relating to portfolio turnover.
HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?
Tier 1 – The Scheme benchmark would be CRISIL Hybrid 50 + 50 Moderate Index
The performance of the scheme will be benchmarked to the performance of a hybrid portfolio having a blend of BSE 200
(50%) and CRISIL Composite Bond Fund Index (50%). As required under SEBI Master Circular on Mutual Funds dated June
27, 2024, the CRISIL Hybrid 50 + 50 Moderate Index has been selected from amongst those notified by AMFI as the first-
tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds for dynamic asset allocation funds under the hybrid category. As the fund
is mandated to invest in equity and debt dynamically, CRISIL Hybrid 50 + 50 Moderate Index would be an appropriate
benchmark to compare the performance of the Scheme.
The Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for the evaluation of the performance of the Scheme from time to
time, keeping in mind the investment objective of the Scheme and the appropriateness of the benchmark, subject to the
compliance with Regulations/ circulars issued by SEBI and AMFI in this regard from time to time.

PART III. OTHER DETAILS
A. COMPUTATION OF NAV
The AMC shall compute NAV of the Units of the Scheme. This will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme by
the number of Units outstanding on the valuation date. The AMC shall value its investments according to the valuation norms
(Valuation Policy), as specified in the Eighth Schedule of the Regulations, or such guidelines / recommendations as may be
specified by SEBI from time to time. The broad valuation norms are detailed in the Statement of Additional Information.
NAV of Units under the Scheme will be calculated as shown below:
Market or Fair Value of Scheme’s + Current assets including - Current Liabilities and provisions
investments Accrued Income including accrued expenses
NAV= No. of Units outstanding under the Scheme/Option
NAV for the Scheme and the repurchase prices of the Units will be calculated and announced at the close of each Business
Day. The NAV shall be computed upto four decimals. The NAV of Direct Plan will be different from the NAV of Regular Plan.
The income earned and the profits realized in respect of the Units issued under the Growth Option remain invested and are
reflected in the NAV of the Units.
Illustrations for computation of NAV:
Say,
Market or Fair Value of Scheme’s investments= Rs. 10,00,00,000
Current assets including accrued income = Rs. 10,00,000
Current Liabilities and provisions including accrued expenses = Rs.2,00,000
No. of units outstanding under the scheme = 10000000
NAV=(100000000+1000000-200000)/10000000
Hence NAV of the scheme will be = Rs. 10.0800
As required under the Regulations, the asset management company shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open-
ended scheme shall not be lower than 95% of the Net Asset Value.
NAV will also be displayed on the website of Unifi Asset Management & in the website of AMFI. In addition, the ISCs would
also display NAV.
For other details such as policies w.r.t computation of NAV, rounding off, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc.

AMC shall not be eligible to charge the above-mentioned additional expenses for such scheme.
Illustration:
Impact of Expense Ratio on Scheme's return:
Expense ratio, normally expressed as a percentage of Average Assets under Management, is calculated by dividing the
permissible expenses under the Regulations by the average net assets. To further illustrate the above in rupees terms, for
the Scheme under reference, suppose an Investor invested Rs. 10,000/- (after deduction of stamp duty and transaction
charges, if any) the impact of expenses charged will be as under:
Particulars Regular Plan Direct Plan
Amount invested at the beginning of 10,000 10,000
the year (Rs.)
Returns before expenses (Rs.) 1,000 1,000
Expenses other than Distribution 150 150
expenses (Rs.)
Distribution expenses (Rs.) 50 -
Returns after expenses at the end of 800 850
the year (Rs.)
Returns (in %) 8% 8.5%
Note(s):
• The purpose of the above illustration is purely to explain the impact of expense ratio charged under the Scheme
and should not be construed as providing any kind of investment advice or guarantee of returns on investments.
• It is assumed that the expenses charged are evenly distributed throughout the year.
• The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses/commission.
• Any tax impact has not been considered in the above example, in view of the individual nature of the tax
implications. Each investor is advised to seek appropriate advice.

TER for the Segregated Portfolio
1. AMC shall not charge investment and advisory fees on the segregated portfolio. However, TER (excluding the investment
and advisory fees) can be charged, on a pro-rata basis only upon recovery of the investments in segregated portfolio.
2. The TER so levied shall not exceed the simple average of such expenses (excluding the investment and advisory fees)
charged on daily basis on the main portfolio (in % terms) during the period for which the segregated portfolio was in
existence.
3. The legal charges related to recovery of the investments of the segregated portfolio may be charged to the segregated
portfolio in proportion to the amount of recovery. However, the same shall be within the maximum TER limit as applicable
to the main portfolio. The legal charges in excess of the TER limits, if any, shall be borne by the AMC.
4. The costs related to segregated portfolio shall in no case be charged to the main portfolio.

SECTION II
Introduction
A. Definitions/interpretation:
The investors may refer to the website of the Company at link https://unifimf.com/glossary/for definition of terms used in
this Scheme Information Document.
Risk factors:
I. Scheme Specific Risk Factors:
Risks associated with investments in Equity and Equity related instruments
•Equity and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. The liquidity of
investments made in the Scheme may be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods. Settlement periods may
be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases,
due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to
sell securities held in the Scheme portfolio would result at times, in potential losses to the Scheme, should there be a
subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme portfolio. Also, the value of the Scheme investments may
be affected by interest rates, currency exchange rates, changes in law/ policies of the government, taxation laws and
political, economic or other developments which may have an adverse bearing on individual securities, a specific sector or
all sectors.
• Investments in equity and equity related securities involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme
unless they can afford to take the risk of loss.
• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the
scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be
extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities.
27
•The AMC may invest in to be listed securities within the regulatory limit. This may however increase the risk of the portfolio
as these to be listed securities are inherently illiquid in nature and carry larger liquidity risk as compared to the listed
securities or those that offer other exit options to the investors.
Risks associated with investments in Fixed Income Securities
Interest-Rate Risk: Fixed income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, money market instruments and
derivatives run price-risk or interest-rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of existing fixed income securities
fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.
The extent of fall or rise in the prices depends upon the coupon and maturity of the security. It also depends upon the yield
level at which the security is being traded.
Re-investment Risk: Investments in fixed income securities carry re-investment risk as interest rates prevailing on the
coupon payment or maturity dates may differ from the original coupon of the bond.
Basis Risk: The underlying benchmark of a floating rate security or a swap might become less active or may cease to exist
and thus may not be able to capture the exact interest rate movements, leading to loss of value of the portfolio.
Spread Risk: In a floating rate security the coupon is expressed in terms of a spread or mark up over the benchmark rate. In
the life of the security this spread may move adversely leading to loss in value of the portfolio. The yield of the underlying
benchmark might not change, but the spread of the security over the underlying benchmark might increase leading to loss
in value of the security.
Liquidity Risk: The liquidity of a bond may change, depending on market conditions leading to changes in the liquidity
premium attached to the price of the bond. At the time of selling the security, the security can become illiquid, leading to
loss in value of the portfolio.
Liquidity Risk on account of unlisted securities: The liquidity and valuation of the Schemes‘ investments due to their holdings
of unlisted securities may be affected if they have to be sold prior to their target date of divestment. The unlisted security
can go down in value before the divestment date and selling of these securities before the divestment date can lead to
losses in the portfolio.
Credit Risk: This is the risk associated with the issuer of a debenture/bond or a Money Market Instrument defaulting on
coupon payments or in paying back the principal amount on maturity. Even when there is no default, the price of a security
may change with expected changes in the credit rating of the issuer. It is to be noted here that a Government Security is a
sovereign security and is the safest. Corporate bonds carry a higher amount of credit risk than Government Securities.
Within corporate bonds also there are different levels of safety and a bond rated higher by a particular rating agency is
safer than a bond rated lower by the same rating agency.
Settlement Risk: Fixed income securities run the risk of settlement which can adversely affect the ability of the fund house
to swiftly execute trading strategies which can lead to adverse movements in NAV.
Risk associated with Securitized Debt:
The Scheme may invest in domestic securitized debt such as Asset Backed Securities (ABS) or Mortgage Backed Securities
(MBS). ABS are securitized debts where the underlying assets are receivables arising from various loans including
automobile loans, personal loans, loans against consumer durables, etc. MBS are securitized debts where the underlying
assets are receivables arising from loans backed by mortgage of residential / commercial properties.
At present in Indian market, following types of loans are securitized:
1. Auto Loans (cars / commercial vehicles /two wheelers)
2. Residential Mortgages or Housing Loans
28
3. Consumer Durable Loans
4. Personal Loans
5. Corporate Loans
In terms of specific risks attached to securitization, each asset class would have different underlying risks. Residential
Mortgages generally have lower default rates than other asset classes, but repossession becomes difficult. On the other
hand, repossession and subsequent recovery of commercial vehicles and other auto assets is fairly easier and better
compared to mortgages. Asset classes like personal loans, credit card receivables are unsecured and in an economic
downturn may witness higher default. A corporate loan/receivable, depend upon the nature of the underlying security for
the loan or the nature of the receivable and the risks correspondingly fluctuate.
The other main risks pertaining to Securitised debt are as follows:
Prepayment Risk: This arises when the borrower pays off the loan sooner than expected. When interest rates decline,
borrowers tend to pay off high interest loans with money borrowed at a lower interest rate, which shortens the average
maturity of ABS. However, there is some prepayment risk even if interest rates rise, such as when an owner pays off a
mortgage when the house is sold or an auto loan is paid off when the car is sold.
Reinvestment Risk: Since prepayment risk increases when interest rates decline, this also introduces reinvestment risk,
which is the risk that the principal can only be reinvested at a lower rate.
Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities
The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to
the risk factors associated with debt instruments.
-Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt
instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall
undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like
a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on
stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by
hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE
rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer
rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.
Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements.
Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as
well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared
to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell
such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.
Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated derives rating based on the combined strength of the
issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact
on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due
to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions,
co-mingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.
Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk.
Risks associated with investments in Derivatives
• The Scheme may invest in derivative products in accordance with and to the extent permitted under the Regulations and
by RBI. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from
29
those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying
instrument but of the derivative itself. Trading in derivatives carries a high degree of risk although they are traded at a
relatively small amount of margin which provides the possibility of great profit or loss in comparison with the principal
investment amount. Thus, derivatives are highly leveraged instruments. Even a small price movement in the underlying
security could have an impact on their value and consequently, on the NAV of the Units of the Scheme.
• Investment in derivatives also requires the maintenance of adequate controls to monitor the transactions entered into,
the ability to assess the risk that a derivative adds to the portfolio and the ability to forecast price or interest rate
movements correctly. Even a small price movement in the underlying security could have an impact on their value and
consequently, on the NAV of the Units of the Scheme.
• The Scheme may face execution risk, whereby the rates seen on the screen may not be the rate at which the ultimate
execution of the derivative transaction takes place.
• The Scheme may find it difficult or impossible to execute derivative transactions in certain circumstances. For example,
when there are insufficient bids or suspension of trading due to price limit or circuit breakers, the Scheme may face a
liquidity issue.
• The options buyer's risk is limited to the premium paid, while the risk of an options writer is unlimited. However the gains
of an options writer are limited to the premiums earned.
• The exchange may impose restrictions on exercise of options and may also restrict the exercise of options at certain times
in specified circumstances and this could impact the value of the portfolio.
• The writer of a call option bears a risk of loss if the value of the underlying asset increases above the exercise price.
• Investments in index futures face the same risk as the investments in a portfolio of shares representing an index. The
extent of loss is the same as in the underlying stocks. The Scheme bears a risk that it may not be able to correctly forecast
future market trends or the value of assets, indices or other financial or economic factors in establishing derivative positions
for the Scheme.
• The risk of loss in trading futures contracts can be substantial, because of the low margin deposits required, the extremely
high degree of leverage involved in futures pricing and the potential high volatility of the futures markets.
• There is the possibility that a loss may be sustained by the portfolio as a result of the failure of another party (usually
referred to as the "counter party") to comply with the terms of the derivatives contract. The counter party may default on
a transaction before settlement and therefore, the Scheme is compelled to negotiate with another counterparty at the then
prevailing (possibly unfavourable) market price.
• Derivatives also carry a market liquidity risk where the derivatives cannot be sold (unwound) at prices that reflect the
underlying assets, rates and indices.
• Where derivatives are used for hedging, such use may involve a basis risk where the instrument used as a hedge does not
match the movement in the instrument/underlying asset being hedged. The risk may be inter-related also e.g. interest rate
movements can affect equity prices, which could influence specific issuer/industry assets.
• Other risks in using derivatives include the risk of mispricing or improper valuation of derivatives and the inability of
derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.
•Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses
to the investor / unitholder. Execution of investment strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager(s) to identify
such opportunities which may not be available at all times. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by
the fund manager(s) involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager(s) may not always be profitable. No assurance can
be given that the fund manager(s) will be able to identify or execute such strategies.
30
• The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with
investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
The following are certain additional risks involved with use of fixed income derivatives:
Interest rate risk:
Derivatives carry the risk of adverse changes in the price due to change in interest rates.
Liquidity risk: During the life of the derivative, the benchmark might become illiquid and might not be fully capturing the
interest rate changes in the market, or the selling, unwinding prices might not reflect the underlying assets, rates and indices,
leading to loss of value of the portfolio.
Risks associated with Covered Call Strategy
The risk associated with covered calls is the loss of upside, i.e. if the shares are assigned (called away), the option seller
forgoes any share price appreciation above the option strike price.
The Scheme may write covered call option only in case it has adequate number of underlying equity shares as per regulatory
requirement. This would lead to setting aside a portion of investment in underlying equity shares. If covered call options are
sold to the maximum extent allowed by regulatory authority, the scheme may not be able to sell the underlying equity
shares immediately if the view changes to sell and exit the stock. The covered call options need to be unwound before the
stock positions can be liquidated. This may lead to a loss of opportunity, or can cause exit issues if the strike price at which
the call option contracts have been written become illiquid. Hence, the scheme may not be able to sell the underlying equity
shares, which can lead to temporary illiquidity of the underlying equity shares and result in loss of opportunity.
The writing of covered call option would lead to loss of opportunity due to appreciation in value of the underlying equity
shares. Hence, when the appreciation in equity share price is more than the option premium received the scheme would
be at a loss. The total gross exposure related to option premium paid and received must not exceed the regulatory limits of
the net assets of the scheme. This may restrict the ability of Scheme to buy any options.
Risks associated with Repo transactions in Corporate Bonds
The Scheme may be exposed to counter party risk in case of repo lending transactions in the event of the counterparty
failing to honour the repurchase agreement. However, in repo transactions, the collateral may be sold and a loss is realized
only if the sale price is less than the repo amount. The risk is further mitigated through over-collateralization (the value of
the collateral being more than the repo amount).
Risks associated with segregated portfolio
1. Investor holding units of segregated portfolio may not able to liquidate their holding till the time recovery of money from
the issuer.
2. Security comprises of segregated portfolio may not realise any value.
3. Listing of units of segregated portfolio on recognised stock exchange does not necessarily guarantee their liquidity. There
may not be active trading of units in the stock market. Further trading price of units on the stock market may be significantly
lower than the prevailing NAV.
Risks associated with Securities Lending
Securities Lending is lending of securities through an approved intermediary to a borrower under an agreement for a
specified period with the condition that the borrower will return equivalent securities of the same type or class at the end
of the specified period along with the corporate benefits accruing on the securities borrowed. There are risks inherent in
securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary to comply with the
31
terms of the agreement. Such failure can result in a possible loss of rights to the collateral, the inability of the approved
intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of corporate benefits accruing thereon.
Risk Factors associated with Credit Default Swap
Credit Risks- Couter party default creates a considerable risk in swap agreements. Parties may default on payment
obligations.
Market Risks- CDS can be highly volatile in value, shifting with the underlying credit quality or general market conditions
and could realise significant losses.
The Indian CDS market is still in its growing stage and lacks proper depth.
Risks associated with investment in units of mutual fund
Investment in Mutual Fund Units involves investment risks, including but not limited to risks such as liquidity risk, volatility
risk, default risk including the possible loss of principal.
• Liquidity risk – The liquidity of the scheme’s investments is inherently restricted by trading volumes and settlement
periods. In the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests, or of a restructuring of the scheme’s
investment portfolio, these periods may become significant. In view of the same, the right to limit redemptions will
be in accordance with SEBI mandated process.
• Volatility risks: There is the risk of volatility in markets due to external factors like liquidity flows, changes in the business
environment, economic policy etc. The scheme will manage volatility risk through diversification across companies and
sectors.
• Default risk - Credit risk is risk resulting from uncertainty in counterparty's ability or willingness to meet its
contractual obligations. This risk pertains to the risk of default of payment of principal and interest. Government Securities
have zero credit risk while other debt instruments are rated according to the issuer's ability to meet the obligations.
Risk Associated with investment in Instruments having Special Features:
Credit Risk/Principal at risk: The issuer has the option to write off the principal in times of severe financial stress.
Since these bonds are unsecured investor will have any recourse to recover money in case issuer write off the
principal. Such bonds may get converted into equity on happening of certain pre-defined event.
Central Bank may instruct issuer of the bonds to write down the entire value of its outstanding AT1 bonds, if it thinks the
bank has passed the Point of Non Viability (PONV), or requires a capital infusion to remain a going concern.
Also, issuer may not pay interest under certain circumstances. Such interest can not be recovered in future also.
Interest Rate Risk: where there is no defined maturity, it may yield lower interest especially when the interest rates are rising.
Liquidity Risk : There is no surety that bond holder will get your principal back on the call date as the issuer may choose to
extend the tenure of bonds at a future date. Bond holder has the option of selling these bonds in the secondary market but
bond holder may have to exit at a loss as the bond’s price may differ from the cost price. Also, some of these are bonds are
thinly traded, which means there are limited buyers.
Risk factors associated with investment in unrated securities:
The scheme may invest in unrated securities as permitted under regulation. Investment in unrated securities involve a risk
of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific
developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating
32
economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to
be less liquid than rated debt securities.
Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo:
The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India
(CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally
through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; thus reducing the settlement and counterparty risks
considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated
by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure
of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism,
after the defaulter’s margins and the defaulter’s contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL’s contribution
is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL’s contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default
fund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund
contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed
to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall
maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any
default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its
members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of
CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/ default losses of another
member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund
Risk associated with potential change in Tax structure
This summary of tax implications given in the taxation section is based on the current provisions of the applicable tax laws.
This information is provided for general purpose only. The current taxation laws may change due to change in the ‘Income
Tax Act 1961’ or any subsequent changes/amendments in Finance Act/Rules/Regulations. Any change may entail a higher
outgo to the scheme or to the investors by way of securities transaction taxes, fees, taxes etc. thus adversely impacting
the scheme and its returns.
B. Risk mitigation strategies:
Type of Instruments Mitigation Measures
Equity Markets/ Equity Oriented Instruments The scheme will comply with the prescribed SEBI limits on exposure.
Risk will be monitored, and necessary action would be taken on the
portfolio, if required. Attribution analysis will be done to monitor the
under or over performance vis-a-vis the benchmark and the reasons
for the same.
Portfolio volatility & concentration The overall volatility of the portfolio
would be maintained in line with the objective of the scheme Volatility
would be monitored with respect to the benchmark.
Liquidity The scheme will predominantly invest across market
capitalisation which are actively traded and thereby liquid. The liquidity
would be monitored, and necessary action would be taken on the
portfolio if required. Stock turnover is monitored at regular intervals.
Debt and Money Market instruments Interest Rate Risk: The scheme would typically have a low to medium
duration portfolio. The scheme may take positions in interest rate
derivatives to hedge market/interest rate risks.
Credit risk or default risk: The Fund will endeavour to minimise
Credit/Default risk by primarily investing in investment grade fixed
33
Type of Instruments Mitigation Measures
income securities (AAA to BBB) rated by SEBI registered credit rating
agencies. These securities carry relatively lower possibility of a default.
Historical default rates for investment grade securities (BBB and
above) have been low.
Reinvestment Risk: Reinvestment risks will be limited to the extent of
coupons received on debt instruments, which will be a very small
portion of the portfolio value.
Liquidity or Marketability Risk: The fund will endeavour to minimise
liquidity risk by investing in securities having a liquid market.
Derivatives The Scheme may invest in derivative for the purpose of hedging,
portfolio balancing and other purposes as may be permitted under the
Regulations. Equity Derivatives will be used in the form of Index
Options, Index Futures, Stock Options and Stock Futures and other
instruments as may be permitted by SEBI.
Debt derivatives will be undertaken as permissible under the SEBI
Mutual Fund Regulations. Derivatives can be either exchange traded or
can be over the counter (OTC).
The Scheme may buy CDS only for the purpose of hedging the credit
risk on debt securities.
Exposure with respect to derivatives shall be in line with regulatory
limits and the limits specified in the SID.
Securities Lending The SLB shall be operated through Clearing Corporation/Clearing
House of stock exchanges having nation-wide terminals who are
registered as Approved Intermediaries (AIs).” The risk is adequately
covered as Securities Lending & Borrowing (SLB) is an Exchange traded
product. Exchange offers an anonymous trading platform and gives the
players the advantage of settlement guarantee without the worries of
counter party default. The fund manager will endeavor to recall the
securities in case lent securities are to be sold
Repo Transactions The choice of counterparties is largely restricted and their credit rating
is taken into account before entering into such transactions. In the
event the counterparty is unable to pay back the money to the scheme
as contracted on maturity, the scheme may dispose of the assets (as
they have sufficient margin) and the net proceeds may be refunded to
the counterparty.
Instruments having Special Features Investment may be done in Additional Tier I bonds and Tier 2 bonds
issued under Basel III framework as permitted under SEBI Mutual Fund
Regulations.
Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Scheme wise investments as prescribed by the regulations limits the
Enhancement (CE) rated securities exposure to such securities. Additionally, covenants of such structured
papers are reviewed periodically for adequate maintenance of covers
as prescribed in the Information Memorandum of such papers.
Unlisted NCD’s & Unrated Securities The scheme may invest in Unlisted NCDs and unrated securities(BRDS,
Usance Bills etc) as permitted under the Regulation.
Government securities and Triparty repo on As a member of securities segment and Triparty repo segment,
Government securities or treasury bills: maintenance of sufficient margin is a mandatory requirement. CCIL
monitors these on a real time basis and requests the participants to
provide sufficient margin to enable the trades etc. Also there are
stringent conditions / requirements before registering any participants
by CCIL in these segments. Since settlement is guaranteed the loss on
34
Type of Instruments Mitigation Measures
this account could be minimal though there could be an opportunity
loss.
Units of mutual fund schemes Mutual Fund portfolios are generally well diversified and typically
endeavor to provide liquidly on a T+1/T+2 basis.
While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these
risks would be completely eliminated.
Securitized Debt
1. How does the risk profile of securitized debt fit into the risk appetite of the Scheme?
The Scheme will always strive to generate incremental returns by investing in quality instruments selected through prudent
investment processes. Accordingly, securitised debt instruments having high credit quality and aligned with the scheme’s
investment objectives will be considered for investment.
The factors typically analyzed for any pool are as follows:
a. Assets securitized and Size of the loan: This indicates the kind of assets financed with the loan and the average ticket
size of the loan. A very low ticket size might mean more costs in originating and servicing of the assets.
b. Diversification: Diversification across geographical boundaries and ticket sizes might result in lower delinquency
c. Loan to Value Ratio: Indicates how much % value of the asset is financed by borrower’s own equity. The lower this value
the better it is. This suggests that where the borrowers own contribution of the asset cost is high; the chances of default
are lower.
d. Average seasoning of the pool: This indicates whether borrowers have already displayed repayment discipline. The higher
the number, the more superior it is.
2. Policy relating to originators:
The Originator is the entity that initially gave the loan and transferred the receivables to an SPV. The Scheme will invest only
in securitised debts whose Originator is a Corporate Entity, such as a Bank, an NBFC, or a listed company.
Policy relating to originators should be based on their nature, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitized debt, etc
The parameters used to evaluate originators are:
✓ Reputation of Originator in the market.
✓ Ability & Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities, etc.
✓ Track record of servicing of the pool or the loan.
✓ Transaction structure includes par versus premium and credit enhancement.
✓ Proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan.
✓ Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions/covenants.
✓ High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower - both on a standalone basis and consolidated level/ group level.
✓ Proportion of restructured assets (if any) in the underlying pools.
✓ Any disputes or litigations in the originated pools.
35
✓ Credit quality and rating.
✓ Loan to Value ratio.
✓ Liquidity facility.
✓ Business risk assessment, wherein the following factors are considered: -
(i) Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)
(ii) Industry & company-specific factors.
In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale are conducted, including interactions with the originator
and rating agency, if needed.
3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator:
The critical evaluation parameters mentioned above would significantly mitigate risk. Further, risk mitigation strategies
typically include additional credit enhancement, over-collateralization, interest subvention, the presence of subordinate
tranches, and analysing the pools' ageing, i.e., how long the loan has been with the Originator before securitisation, etc.
Further internal limits would be set to the level of exposure as well as the tenor for each kind of originator.
Originator analysis typically encompasses (a) the Size and reach of the originator, (b) the Collection process, infrastructure
and follow-up mechanism, (c) the Quality of MIS and (d) Credit enhancement for different types of originators.
4. The level of diversification concerning the underlying assets and risk mitigation measures for less diversified
investments:
Currently, the securitised market in India is not very active. There are only a few kinds of securitised assets available in the
market. The limitation of options has kept the diversification of underlying assets low. However, the Scheme will endeavour
to maintain diversification concerning the underlying assets by investing in diverse types of pools after evaluating each
category based on the approximate average maturity, maximum single exposure, average single exposure, average loan-to-
value ratio, the collateral margin, geographical diversification, etc. Also, a strict pre-investment review of the originators,
underlying assets, and the borrower ‘s credit profile will be conducted.
The level of diversification concerning the underlying assets and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments
eligible assets:
(i) Only assets with an established track record of low delinquencies and high credit quality over several business
cycles will be preferred for investment.
(ii) Analysis of pool: To determine pool quality, characteristics such as average pool maturity (in months), average
loan-to-value ratio, average seasoning, maximum single exposure, geographical distribution, and average single
exposure will be studied.
(iii) Risk mitigating measures: Credit enhancement facilities (including cash, guarantees, excess interest spread,
subordinate tranches), liquidity facilities, and payment structure are studied in relation to the asset class's
historical collection and default behaviour to ensure the adequacy of credit enhancement in a stress scenario.
(iv) The minimum retention period of the debt by the originator before the securitization Scheme will follow the
guidelines on minimum holding period requirements as laid down by SEBI and RBI from time to time.
(v) Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitized: The scheme will follow the guidelines on
minimum holding period requirements laid down by SEBI and RBI from time to time.
36
(vi) The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the Mutual Fund invests in the securitized debt of an originator
and the originator in turn, makes investments in that particular Scheme of the Fund:
(vii) The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitized
debt:
The AMC has a risk management process would evaluate and monitor risks arising from investments in securitized debt.
Further, the risk team would also monitor the exposure norms, liquidity management, and other risks. For securitized pool
loan exposures, the analysis includes pool seasoning, pool asset quality, diversification, collateral margin, originator analysis,
and credit enhancement mechanisms. Pool performance statistics published by rating agencies are analysed for
the performance of other securitised pools of the same originator as well as for the pool.

6. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitization:
RBI has formulated guidelines for minimum retention period of the debt by the originator prior to securitization. Depending
on the tenor of the securitised assets and the type of repayment schedule viz. periodic repayment or bullet repayment,
nine or twelve months, conditions would be prescribed as the minimum retention period before the assets can be
securitised.
7. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitized:
RBI has also prescribed the minimum retention percentage as 5% or 10% of the book value of the loans being securitised
depending on the original maturity of the loans and the features of the securitisation transaction.
8. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitized debt of an originator and
the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund
37
An investment by the scheme in any security is done after detailed analysis by the Fixed Income team and in accordance
with the investment objectives and the asset allocation pattern of a scheme. All investments are made on an arm’s length
basis without consideration of any investments (existing/potential) in the scheme made by any party related/involved
in the transaction. The robust credit process ensures that there is no conflict of interests when a scheme invests in
securitized debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme. Normally the
issuer who is securitizing instrument is in need of money and is unlikely to have long term surplus to invest in mutual
fund scheme.
Furthermore, there is clear cut segregation of duties and responsibilities with respect to Investment function and
Sales function. Investment decisions are being taken independently based on the above mentioned parameters and
investment by the originator in the scheme is based on their own evaluation of the scheme vis a vis their investment
objectives.
9. In general, the resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in
securitized debt:
Rating changes of the securitized debt forming part of the portfolio are monitored continuously by the risk team.
Independent rating agencies would also provide their periodical reviews and assign changes if needed. The investment team
can analyse and monitoring their portfolio comprising securitized debt. The periodic reports received by the AMC on pool
performance will be verified to check for any change in asset quality and related impact on debt servicing and any impact
that it can have on the credit ratings.
38

B. Features of Debt Market & Instruments:
Debt Market:
Broadly, the Indian Debt Market is divided into two parts viz. the Money Market and the Debt market. Money market
instruments have a tenor of less than one year while debt market instruments have a tenor of more than one year. Money
market instruments are typically commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills, trade bills, repos, interbank call
money etc. Debt market comprises typically of securities issued by Governments (Central and State), Banks, Financial
Institutions, and Companies in the private and public sector, Corporations, Statutory Bodies etc.
The debt securities are mainly negotiated and traded over the telephone directly, market terminals like Bloomberg, Retuers
and / or through brokers. The National Stock Exchange of India has a separate trading platform called the Wholesale Debt
40
Market segment where trades put through member brokers are reported. RBI has introduced the Negotiated Dealing System
(NDS) platform for screen-based trading in Government Securities and Money Market instruments. Most of the market
participants are now operating through NDS. Incorporated in April 2001 by key financial institutions, The Clearing
Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL), guarantees the settlement of all trades executed through NDS. The Counter party Credit
Risk and Operational Risks are thus mitigated by CCIL thereby facilitating a smooth settlement process.
The following table gives indicative yields prevailing as on April 30, 2025, on some of the money and debt market
instruments. Investors must note that the yields shown below can fluctuate considerably due to interest rates movements,
regulatory policy transformations, macro-economic developments, demand supply dynamics, company specific news
flows including credit rating changes.

mean that they can be classified on the basis of any of these features.
List of Features: (list is indicative)
• Face Value: Stated value of the paper /Principal Amount
• Coupon: Zero, fixed or floating
• Frequency: Semi-annual; annual, sometimes quarterly or Monthly
• Maturity: Bullet, staggered
• Redemption: Face Value; premium or discount
• Options: Call/Put Issue Price: Par (Face Value) or premium or discount.

transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators/Banks/Exchanges etc),
it may happen that the investor’s account is debited, but the money is not credited
within cut-off time on the same date to the Scheme’s bank account, leading to a
gap/delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient
electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in
Unit allotment.
